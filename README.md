# Meccha Camouflage

A standalone Windows desktop tool for MECCHA CHAMELEON camouflage experiments.

## Download

Download the latest `meccha-camouflage.exe` from GitHub Releases:

- https://github.com/acentrist/MecchaCamouflage/releases/latest

## Usage

1. Start MECCHA CHAMELEON.
2. Start `meccha-camouflage.exe`.
3. Confirm the target process and bridge state in the app.
4. Press the saved paint hotkey.

Settings are read-only until `Edit` is selected. Use `Save` to apply changes or
`Cancel` to discard them.

v1.4.0 uses the mesh-first paint route. Game-derived mesh profiles are prepared
locally from the research tools after game updates; they are not ordinary source
files. See [docs/research-tools.md](docs/research-tools.md) for the local tool
setup and update workflow.
